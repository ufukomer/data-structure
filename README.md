### Data Structure â€” Linked Queue, Tree, Sorting Algorithm Speed Analysis
A university project created using JavaFX software platform. To have an idea about the project content, read below.

#### Linked Queue
Simple linked queue structure in which all nodes has a process time.

#### Sorting Algorithm Analysis
Program generates array of integers according to input then sort this array with Bitonic, Counting, Heap, Radix, Merge and Shell sort algorithms. At the end, shows analysis result on pie and bar charts.
